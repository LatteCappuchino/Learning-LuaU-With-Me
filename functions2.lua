Here, you will learn about functions.

function maths(num1, num2)
print(num1+num2)
end
maths(1, 1)

This starts with a function that had to be used by firing it.
  Function's name is "maths", it has 2 "variables", num1 and num2.
    All it does is prints num1+num2.
maths(1, 1)
    This fires the function, and gives it 2 variables. 1 and 1.
      It will output 2, because the function checks the given variables, and uses them in itself.
        It does:
        print(1+1)
function Print()
  print("Hello!")
        end
        Print()
        This function doesn't need nor use variables.
          All it does is print "Hello!" to the Console.
          To fire it, we must do Print()
