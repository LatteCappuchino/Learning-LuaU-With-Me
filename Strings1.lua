Strings in Roblox are Very Important for Things Like

print("string")

So, Why not We Learn Them?

A "String" is Equal to a Message or A Text.
Here's A Quick Example of a String:
```
local string="Hello World!"
print(string)
__Console Output:__
Hello World!
```
In this Script, the **local string="Hello World!"** stores a Variable, Which is a "String".
print(string) outputs the Variable into Our Console, which Outputs **Hello World!**

So, Strings are Simply __Messages__.

When Using Strings in something, You can use Both of the strings, by adding 2 dots before the next string.

```
local str1="Hello"
local str2="World!"
print(str1 .. " " .. str2)
Output: Hello World!
```
This script gets 2 Variables:
"Hello", "World!"
Theyre used later for "Merging" them into 1 Sentence.
print(str1 .. " " .. str2)
This stroke o' code prints them into "Hello World!"
The 2 dots are "Dividers", because if you do
print(str1 " " str2)
it would error.
The " " Acts as a Space for the sentence.
```
local str="Hello World!"
print(string.lower(str))
Output: hello world!
```
string.lower Switches ALL the Uppercase letters into Lowercase letters.

```
local str="Hello World!"
print(string.upper(str))
Output:HELLO WORLD!
```
string.upper just Switches ALL The Lowercase letters to Uppercase Letters.

That's all for lesson 1. Cya!!
